    What this script does
</p>
<p>
    1. It takes XML files from the clinicaltrials.gov database
</p>
<p>
    2. It restructures the data and writes corresponding parts of it into an
    RIS file (clinicaltrials.gov provides more data than what you end up with.
    For the full records, consult the clinicaltirals.gov database through the
    link in the RIS files or the XML files)
</p>

<p>
    5. Open the resulting zip file
</p>
<p>
    6. Create an empty folder of your choice
</p>
<p>
    7. Create an empty sub-folder of the empty folder called ‘Place Unzipped
    Data Here’ (Name MUST match this name for the code to work. Make sure
    capitalisation is the same)
</p>
<p>
    8. Copy all XML files in the zip file into the ‘Place Unzipped Data Here’
    folder
</p>
<p>
    9. Copy the script into your code editor
</p>
<p>
    10. Save the script as ‘Call.py’ into the empty folder of your choice (the
    folder above the ‘Place Unzipped Data Here’ folder)
</p>
<p>
    11. Execute the file (through the command prompt or by double-clicking the
    file)
</p>
<p>
    11.1. A small window executing Python should briefly appear
</p>
<p>
    12. A file called ‘RIS Formatted clinicaltrials-gov Data.ris’ should appear
    in the same folder as Call.py. This should be your fully functional RIS
    file.
