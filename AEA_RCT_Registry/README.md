    <strong>What this script does </strong>
</p>
<p>
1. It goes to the visible website of the    <a href="https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/">AEA RCT Registry</a>
</p>
<p>
    2. It peforms your search (the website does not say which fields are searched, but I suspect all available ones) 
</p>
<p>
    3. It reads in the text
</p>
<p>
    4. It writes the text into an RIS file in a structured manner
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How to use it </strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Copy the code into your code editor
</p>
<p>
    2. Save the code as ‘Call.py’ in an empty folder of your choice
</p>
<p>
    3. In line 14 of the script it reads “search = '(labor AND firm) AND SME'”.
    Change “(labor AND firm) AND SME” to the search term that you want search
    for
</p>
<p>
    4. Save the file
</p>
<p>
    5. Execute the file (through the command prompt or by double-clicking the
    file)
</p>
<p>
    5.1. A small window executing Python should appear
</p>
<p>
    5.2. It can take a while until the code is fully executed (depending on the
    amount of hits a few minutes or more)
</p>
<p>
    6. A file called ‘APAcrawl.ris’ should appear in the same folder as
    Call.py. This should be your fully functional RIS file.
